</body>
   <p>Assalamualaikum to whom ever is reading this.</p>
   <h4>This is actually a diary about my second girl friend in this world,but the first i ever loved between the two(whom i wish to be my future wife(inshallah ) Amen).</h4>
<p>This reason am writting this is that i want to express my self by writting things,and am going to start the story now.  </p>
  <p>it all start when i started my new madrasat(kamaldeen father),i was known to be a silent person,being called(alfa jeje).      And i don't really talk to other student,trying to be anonimous.</p>
  <p><h5>one day she started sitting next to me for about 5-6 days,we do talk a little,she ask me questions alot like,(if i just kiss can i come to masjid an perform salat,i said yes.(2) which school am i attending i said okesuna high school.(3) do i know a bunch of is friend she mentions,i said yes.....  and so on</h5></p>
  <p>Few days later i started loving her so i told my friends at madrasat(mubarak and kamaldeen) so they started teasing me and do help me get along with her a little,  then aishat(Mubarak girlfriend/wife) knows about it and she help me talk to her by the grace of GOD.</p>
  <div>BUT still told me that i need to talk to her my self, so i approch a on the 7th of december 2022 telling her/asking her can she be my girlfriend with the courage of GOD, she didn't say anything that day.</div>
  <p>Days goes by, on the 14th of december she said yes,she will like to be my girlfriend but this are the obstacles.</p>
  <li>i already have a boyfriend(fuad my childhood friend)</li>
  <li>if i see both of them together i shoundn't be jealous because he is the main guy</li>
  <li>i shound't react because i know him.</li>
  <p>She ask will i be jealous? i said yes but i want you to say NO, BECAUSE i already forget about it,then she walked away </p>
    <p>we do talk alot now  ,she coming to my house ones or twice in a week,on the 18th of december 2022,she came to my house and ask me to come to madrast,i said ok,i went there and i saw her feching water she asked to wait,few minute later she came inside and she gave me  drink (maltina),i ask her why do you give me ? she said i ask you to come so that why i gave you this for the stress you go though.</p>
    <div>i try to regect it but she instead said no, we talked for a while and she went to the back of our madrasat close to her house,then we talked for a while,not long she closed her eyes and i hug her(first time) then i make a sound like you kiss someone but you didn't really kiss that person.</div>
     <p>she make a sound that goes like this hmmm,then put her hand behind my back and draw me towards her and hold my head,then the magic start.<div>we kiss for some seconds,then she ask me that what i want right, i said no. </div> </p>
     <p>she said she as given me what i want,i said no,she ask what did i want,i said want you,she said me? i said yes you. she smile then we went back to to the masjid watching those who are doing there marriage that day,try to dance together and stuffs. </p>
     <div>she said i should come to her house the other day(monday),but i didn't,that day she said she is going to come  to my house on (tuesday)but she didn't,that day she said i should come on (thursday)that is mother is travelling that day,i said thank GOD,so nobody will disturb us,she smile. </div>
   <li>On the 20th of december, we talked the minute goes by because our ustaz is not around,we have a lot of fun i touched her side,i try to carry her and so on.....  i saw that she wasn't wearing her hijab very well so i adjust it,then she went on fireüò°üò†,she hiss and went inside,when we finished madrasat i try to talk to her,she as a misunderstanding withone of our madrasat student,she went awired/angryüò†üò°üò†üò°</li>
   <p>she was walking to her house,then i stoped her and plead with her,she said she as heard.I try to hug her,we hug a little as i was going back i told her that(i love you) with my lips,she repond back i love you too by whispering and using her hand for sign, that happened yesterday. </p>
   <p> on the 21th of december 2022,we talked for a while,she told me that her and a student in our madrasat could have fought yesterday,if not me that i was there my face that she saw,she will have slaped her,  few minute we have a misunderatanding,after the class we said goodbye to ourself and she i asked should i still come tommorow?she said yes,i asked which time is it 10:AM or 11:AM, she shouted don't disturb me,i left her with a sad face then i went home</p>
   <div>but b√©fore that, i saw her before we started madrasat we talk and she said she bought food(indomine) say√≠ng the money is not complete so she is finding money to complete it,but that moment i was'nt holding any money she she said i should be fast,that we should eat it together,i said ok </div>
     <p>When the food was done,i was doing something with my friend so i wasn't able to eat it,she told me to meet her inside her house but i didn't go.</p>
  <h1>Am kind-of thinking maybe i should  redraw for this thing because am not that can of relationship guy(being alone is my thing)</h1>
    <p> Aishat(mubarak girlfriend/wife) even told me that fuad(sofia main guy) is asking her(sofia) for the ultimate reason for relationship(S‚òÖX),at this stage.</p>
    22th of December 2022,i went to her house along with my friend (Mubarak zakariyah),i left him in the masjid and i went to meet her at the back of her house,i helped her to watch plate and i touch her head(first time),i went inside are house we talked,i asked her to borrow me a certain amount she said she don't borrow people money she give them,so she gave me but i return it because i don't really need it,she said she is finding money for new year clothes.
    <p>she told me she isn't going to be around for a while, because she want to do the new year at his cousin house,also speaking about her friend (Adio),i felt somehow but stay strong, we talked for a while,and she told me she want to  take a bath so i crack a joke(let bath together),she said i should leave but i asked her for a hug,we hug a little,then someone interrupt by saying nonsense,few minutes later,she ask me to leave with a high tone,i said ok bye</p>
<p>Has i was going she was  talking to my friend(Mubarak zakariyah) and i joined, chatting for a while,few minutes we left but before i leave her,i said bye and she look me with a bad eyes...   (me feeling somehow depressed.) </p>
<p>At night in madirasat,i saw her she was walking inside her house,she said she is not coming to madirasat.When we finish madrasat,i was talking to her brother,then she came to give her brother something,we have a full eyes contact with each other (i think she smiled),then she went to shop(freeman)</p>
<h3><strong>we didn't talk at all.</strong></h3>
<p>we didn't see each other on friday,but i feel like seeing her so much because have miss her.On Saturday we didn't see each other even she didn't come to my house üè†,i feel like seeing her so i went to her house at night around 9:56pm.   </p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
Am feeling like she doesn't like me, maybe since we have k¬¢ss,she didn't want me again,may we are not ment to be together. maybe because she use to say i should come so i didn't usually go/on time and she will have cooked for me later she will end up eating it alone/with her friends. maybe she is not really the thing.
   <h3>Me feeling for her</h3>
i use to feel happy whenever I set my eyes on her,i pray she is my future wife but is that normal? praying for the future now,but i really love her now, before no,i don't even put her on my mind,all of a sudden i just start thinking of her,i sometimes think maybe she might be my future wife at the same time maybe she is not,we do alot of things together,the ones I never do to a girl before (the good things),i just want her, WELL GOD IS THE PLANNER,HE PLAN PERFECTLY.(ALIHAMDULILAI).BUT I STILL LOVE HER.
  <h5>she dance in front of me alot, asking me,do i dance well i will say no she dance like a badly, asking me religious questions, teaching me how to read the QURAN (holy book), telling me about her friends the boys and girls,i do touch her bottom alot,breast ones(intentionally), mistakenly (many times) kiss(ones) touch her body(alot), hugging her(sometimes), telling her(i love her) twice,she telling me she love me (once),she asking me will i kiss her?(once),she hugging me(once),she coming to my house/around my house because of me(many times), asking me to come to her house(alot), telling me about her birthday day(4 times),she telling me about her boyfriend fuad(many times) which i don't like, we did alot of wonderful lovely perfect thing together i can't even mention, i love not because of that,but because of it ALLAH THE EVERYTHING IN ALL THINGS, it because of ALLAH (GOD) that i loved her and i wish we should be together forever after,but if ALLAH will not well it's fine with me because he is the planner, the one who knows what is good for me and her,(i pray i should be among the perfect person in this world and hereafter with money, health,wife,son, greatest, mighty,most of all with Allah.)</h5>
  <p><h2>TODAY IS 25TH OF DECEMBER 2022,I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE ON FRIDAY 23TH OF DECEMBER 2022.</h2></p>
 <h1> () I SEEK GOD GUARDIANS ()</h1>
25th of December 2022,at night both of our friend(sadam)told me that she said she is coming to 26th of December 2022,have been expecting her since 10:am.
<h2><div>Alihamdulilai robilalamin </div></h2>
26th of December 2022,at night I went to madirasat, she didn't come but i saw her she was talking to her brother,after we finished madirasat, I went to go and meet her ÿßŸÜ,i greeted her at first she didn't respond so she walked a little bit farder,i greeted her and she shouted(ahh don't talk to me, with anger),i left her with sadness.
  <p>But look at the bright side,am afraid maybe this relationship os about to end,not that am happy but,i don't know how to talk to people,how to react with them, how to smile, laugh,cry, walk,sleep and so on</p>
 <h3>üò£üò•üòñüò¢üò≠Am afraid this story is about to endüò£üò•üòñüò¢üò≠</h3> 
    Today 28th of December 2022,when we finished madrasat,i was talking to her brother about something,she came to her brother whispering to his hears about something,as she was talking to her brother she was also smiling and told her brother that she will tell him the rest inside.i was standing in front of them.
     <lo>The thing is that I don't know maybe it's because of me that she is smiling,but we didn't talk we only touch each other with body.</lo>
      <h4>Am so happy</h4>
  <p>Am thinking Maybe i should give her a couple of weeks, maybe she will turn up.</p>
    <p><h2>Assalamualaikum</h2></p>
I remember the day, they did interhouse sport in her school,at night she didn't want to come to madirasat,we were talking outside,i saw almost half of what Allah gave her,the cloth she wear exposed her alot,but she was covering it with another cloth,she came because of me that day,it goes like this.
<li>sofiat: Brother Furqan,have been looking for you</li>  
 <li>me:well am here</li>
  we talked a little about there inter house üè† sport.
<li>sofiat:i don't want to come to madirasat</li>
<li>me:why</li>
<li>sofiat:i don't fell like</li>
<li>me:uurr come on,try to come ok</li>
<li>sofiat : should i come?</li>
 <li>me:yes please,but change your cloth</li> 
<li>sofiat: ok am coming.</li>
  then she came we talked alot, because our ustaz as traveled that day.
  <p>she also ask me a weird question, like am i beautiful,do you like me, should i kiss you,do you have a girl friend, people like you like girls alot, what is your(oriki).  and so on</p>
 <h4>The thing is that am missing her so much, because i really love her,(i left the door to my heart open for her,she entered it and fill it with love,she was certain,she was guaranteed that she will take care of it,i believed then. one day she left it empty no one was there except her,no one is there to keep filling it with love and keep taking care of it.i felt downfall i felt i knew it,this will happen, nothing last forever,things goes and come,this is why i never want to fall in love, this is why i don't want to open the door to someone,but i believed her,but she end up leaving me alone)(Allah is always there for me,he is the only one i loved and the only one i will always love, even my mother leave me alone, even the prophet Muhammad leave me but Allah stays forever) inshallah</h4> 
 <B>i think we should get married me and her(inshallah Amin)</B>
  <ul>i acting like she is died, like she is gone forever,if i want to see her now i can,just to Walk 10minute distance,i think i should go to her house and ask her why is sje doing like this to me now, I should beg her,but the thing is that i don't have the courage to go to someone's house,i use to go when she ask me to come, maybe i should just assumed she asked me to come that why am going, inshallah i will try my best,and it will end up well by GOD grace Amin.</ul>
  <p>on the 29th of December 2022,i went somewhere so i told my friend's to call me when they spot her,so i can beg her on the phone because I was not in Lagos island, Mubarak called me and i asked him to give her the phone,he said she didn't want to talk (she is not collecting the phone) i hanged up and i felt aaaghhhhh (why?)</p>
  <div><h2>HAPPY NEW YEAR (2023)</h2></div>
  <P>THURSDAY 5TH of January 2023, aishat told me that she said that i use to do (first to greet)that why she don't want to talk to me,am kinda surprise that she that, because do I always do that?NO, Ofcourse not i don't have that behavior..</P>
  <section>i love her so much</section>
  <h5>everyday that sadam(me and her friend) use to tell me that she saw her everyday,i always want to see her bit i don't,i saw  her with her mom on Thursday 5th of January 2023,but before that day it as been long.</h5>
 i remember the time she wanted to tell  our first Alfa (Abu HANUUN )that she is my wife,i haven't ask her out then,few days before i ask her out,our second Alfa (that comes from fridaus mosque ) called we both husband and wife,i was so happy that it happened.
 <p> i can't wait to be with her again, together once more</p>
  well today is 8th of January 2023,we are resuming tomorrow.
  9th of january 2023,around 8:05pm i saw her when i was walking withmy friend(ridwan),i told him that she is my girlfriend,he said some words but nevermind so i went closer to her and i greeted her,she talk with high tone.
  her:ooo that why i don't want to come to this place,i don't have time for talking.
  <li>me:am just here to greet you.</li>
<li>  her:ok am fine.</li>
 <li> me:how is everything</li>
<li>  her: it's fine.</li>
 <li> me:so what do you come to do here.</li>
 <li> her:i came to check on (sadam) and his friends,i want to collect my money.</li>
 <li> me:ok so will i see you tomorrow?</li>
 <li>her: are you not coming to madirasat?</li>
 <li> me:hhm ok see you then.</li>
  <li>her: bye</li>
 <li> me: good bye.</li>
 <p>As we were talking,she isn't paying attention to me,she was facing somewhere else, looking at me for a few seconds,not looking at me in the eye,but as i reach madirasat,i greeted everyone including her,few minutes later i was teaching some folks Quran,she joined them and i didn't really face her so few minutes later she went back to her sit.</p>
 <p> we have started talking since that day,but on Thursday 12th of January 2023, i have cancelled her as my love/girlfriend. she even came to meet sadam on Friday 13th, asking him will he go to school on Monday?.   well today is Sunday and i don't want to see her, but i remember the Sunday we kissed that was a perfect mistake i ever made.   Am kinda regretting right now.</p>
